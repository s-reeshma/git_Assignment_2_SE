Version Control with Git –
GitHub hosts Git repositories, letting you track every change in your code, view history, and revert to previous states when needed.

Repositories –
Central storage spaces for your projects including code, documents, issues, and history. Repos can be public (open source) or private.

Branches –
Work on new features or fixes in separate branches without affecting your main codebase, then merge changes back when ready.

Pull Requests (PRs) –
Propose, review, and discuss changes before merging them into the main branch — a cornerstone of collaborative workflows.

Issues & Project Management –
Track bugs, feature requests, tasks, and progress using Issues, labels, and project boards (like Kanban).

GitHub Pages –
Host static websites (e.g., project documentation or personal portfolios) directly from a GitHub repository.

Collaborative Tools (Wikis, Discussions) –
Document your project using Wikis, engage with contributors through Discussions, and follow activity feeds.
